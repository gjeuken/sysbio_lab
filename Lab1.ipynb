    "On this lab, we will try to understand the underlying mechanisms behind differential expression analysis an multiple hypothesis testing. You will be asked to reflect on some core concepts of the methods and to write down your interpretations. It is important that you understand what you are doing, so toghtfull answers are expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully complete the lab you have to answer all questions and submit them in **PDF format** in Canvas. You can, and should, discuss with your classmates.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also be provided with some optional bonus questions that involve a little more research and programing on your part, but succesful completion of those will award you points in the final examination.\n",

    "## 1 Differential expression analysis, an intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have learned, differential expression analysis trys to answer the following question: Is there any **significant** difference between the expression of two (or more) different conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Troghout this lab we will be exploring the concepts using simulated data, which allows us to finelly control what we are looking at and most importantly, know the true model behind the data. Later you will be asked to explore these concepts using real life data, on which you will have to look for the effects without knowing if there is really one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simulated data is very basic, and corresponds to two separatelly generated sets. \n",
    "On the first the data is generated by **two separate** normal distribuitions, with the data points colored acording to which distribuition they are generated from.\n",
    "On the second set, the data is generated by a **single** normal distribuition, but with the same mean and standard deviation as the combined distribuition from the previous set, and where the points are colored at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the language of differential expression, the colors represent de different conditions we want to test (e.g. treated/untreated, healthy/sick, etc.). \n",
    "The second data set then represents our **null hypothesis** $H_0$, that says that there is no difference between the \"expression\" of the two conditions. \n",
    "Finally the first set then represents the **alternative hypothesis** $H_1$ that says that *there is* a difference between the two conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope the explanation of this was clear, but in case you have any questions, please ask the TA as this is fundamental for the rest of the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, let's try to get an intuition on differential expression fist. After executing the code bellow you will be presented with 2 plots and some sliders.\n",
    "The sliders control the parameters used for generating the samples from the two different sets, and plot the results.\n",
    "The catch here is that you do not know which plot represents data under $H_0$ and which represents data under $H_1$.\n",
    "Every time you move one of the sliders, the data is regenerated, and each of the condition is **ploted randomly in the left or right**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Play around with the sliders as long as you feel necessary to answer these questions.\n",
    "An explanation of what the slides control:\n",
    "* Distance: the difference between the mean of each distribuition in $H_1$\n",
    "* Dispersion: the standard deviation $\\sigma$ of those distribuitions\n",
    "* Samples: The number of samples from each distribuition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "* 1.1 What is the influence of **each** variable in your ability to distinguish between $H_0$ and $H_1$?\n",
    "* 1.2 How do the different variables interact with themselves, for the same purpose?\n",
    "* 1.3 It is easy to see that often data under $H_1$ looks like data under $H_0$, but do you think you could ever misidentify data under $H_0$ as data under $H_1$?\n",

Pick a very small distance between both distributions and see if you could make it significant using the other sliders, specially the sample size, and then comment on the relations of statistical significance and biological significance."
